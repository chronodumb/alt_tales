Best to dump it before any double ET drop events come about. That will make the price nosedive and it will never really recover. \n\nAnother useful price check website, where you can see volume vs price:\nhttps://global.poporing.life/?search=Raccoon_leaf",

From further research and asking around I saw that people who played before on CN suggests gakkung becuase it retains the price better there than mystery bow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid a quick price check and a +10gakkung \\[2\\] there with 4th enchantment is still 14m. While a +6Mystery bow \\[2\\] is only 5m at CN.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo its a wiser investment for a 2 slotted weapon than buying a 2 slot mystery bow now worth 17m-20m. I think I would go to the 2 slot +10crossbow with good enchantment for now.",
